## Aim:
The aim of this experiment is to design an AI-powered chatbot tailored to assist customers in a manufacturing context. The chatbot is expected to provide solutions related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general customer service inquiries. The chatbot should be capable of handling a variety of user inputs while maintaining a helpful, conversational, and intuitive interaction style. In this experiment, diverse prompting techniques such as straightforward prompting, tabular format prompting, and preceding question prompting will be used to guide the chatbot development process. These prompts will help design user-friendly conversations and intelligent responses. A use case from Unit 5 will be implemented using prompt styles discussed in Unit 2.

## Scenario and Use Case:
The selected scenario focuses on the manufacturing industry, where companies are striving to improve productivity and reduce downtime through automation and intelligent monitoring. With the rise of Industry 4.0, integrating IoT devices and embedded systems into production environments has become essential.

## Use Case:
The manufacturing plant aims to automate equipment monitoring and control to reduce human dependency and errors. IoT sensors will be embedded into machinery to monitor performance in real time. This system will collect and analyze data to anticipate equipment failures before they occur and suggest preventive measures. The solution will also include cloud dashboards for remote access and control, and energy optimization features that power down idle equipment automatically. The integration of AI will allow operators and managers to make informed decisions quickly, thus improving overall production efficiency.

## Target Audience:
This solution is aimed at manufacturing companies in sectors such as automotive, electronics, and food processing, where uninterrupted production is crucial and automation can result in significant cost savings and quality improvements.

## 1. Use Case Description:
In traditional manufacturing setups, most of the equipment monitoring and maintenance activities are performed manually. This leads to various challenges such as increased response time to failures, unnecessary energy usage, lack of real-time insights, and low production efficiency. There is also a lack of integration between monitoring systems and production control units, which causes delays in decision-making.

With the integration of smart systems using IoT devices, embedded controllers, and cloud platforms, manufacturers can achieve real-time equipment tracking, detect anomalies early, and control machinery remotely. The automated system will continuously collect data from machines and use AI-based analytics to optimize maintenance schedules and energy use. This results in a more connected and responsive production line.

## 2. Problem Identification:
### Key problems identified in the current system include:

1) High Machine Downtime: Lack of predictive maintenance leads to unexpected breakdowns, reducing productivity.

2) Manual Monitoring: Constant human supervision is required, which increases labor costs and introduces the risk of human error.

3) Delayed Responses: In the absence of real-time data, issues are addressed reactively rather than proactively.

4) Energy Wastage: Machines often run even when not in use, leading to unnecessary power consumption.

5) Poor Decision Making: Managers cannot access live system data, making it difficult to make timely operational decisions.

The implementation of automation aims to address these issues and streamline the production workflow.

## 3. Objective Breakdown:
### The core objectives of the proposed solution are:

1) Improve Production Efficiency by 30%: By automating equipment and reducing idle time, the system aims to increase throughput and reduce cycle time.

2) Minimize Machinery Downtime: Predictive maintenance features will ensure that equipment issues are detected before causing failures, minimizing unplanned downtime.

3) Enable Real-Time Monitoring and Remote Control: Dashboards will offer instant access to equipment status and performance, enabling quick adjustments remotely.

3) Reduce Energy Consumption: Smart power management techniques will be used to switch off machines when idle or underutilized, leading to energy savings.

These objectives will guide the overall design and functionality of the system, ensuring that each feature contributes to measurable improvements in productivity and cost-efficiency.

## 4. Prompt Types Used:
Various prompt types were used to simulate interaction design, feature planning, and user communication flows to facilitate the development of this AI-powered system. These prompt types include:

---
1) Straightforward Prompts: Used to directly gather ideas or information. Example: “What features can be added to improve equipment efficiency?”

2) Tabular Format Prompting: Used to compare and evaluate multiple feature options, aiding in decision-making.

3) Preceding Question Prompting: Mimics real conversational flow by allowing the chatbot to anticipate and respond to user needs based on context.

| Feature                     | Cost Impact | Benefit Rating | Implementation Ease |
|----------------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Predictive Maintenance     | High        | High           | Medium              |
| Real-Time Monitoring       | Medium      | High           | High                |
| Energy Usage Optimization  | Low         | Medium         | High                |

These prompting techniques helped shape both the chatbot's content delivery and the overall system behavior in real-world scenarios.

## 5. Idea Generation Prompts:
Using straightforward prompts, we explored core features that the automation system must support. For example:

Prompt: “What features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?”

### Generated Ideas:

1) Integration of temperature, vibration, and motion sensors to monitor machine health.

2) Predictive analytics engine to forecast failures based on historical data.

3) Energy monitoring modules to analyze and optimize consumption patterns.

4) Real-time cloud dashboards accessible from any device.

5) Auto-report generation for performance metrics and maintenance logs.

6) Alert system for anomalies and maintenance needs via SMS or email.

This phase allowed the team to ideate extensively, ensuring no critical component was overlooked during design.

## 6. Persona-Based Prompts:
Understanding the needs of different system users—like machine operators, maintenance engineers, and production managers—was key to designing an intuitive interface.

Prompt: “What should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?”

## Generated Insights:

1) Operators: The interface must highlight critical alerts, offer easy-to-understand visuals, and require minimal training.

2) Managers: Dashboards should display performance metrics, machine status summaries, energy usage graphs, and allow for configuration of alerts.

3) Maintenance Engineers: Access to error logs, predictive maintenance schedules, and component-level diagnostics is crucial.

These insights ensured that the chatbot and system design were aligned with user needs, increasing usability and adoption across roles.

## Conclusion
This experiment successfully demonstrated how diverse prompting techniques can be used to guide the development of an AI-powered system for smart manufacturing. By applying straightforward, tabular, and preceding question prompts, the team was able to generate meaningful ideas, structure design decisions, and align the system with user expectations. The use of these prompting strategies played a crucial role in shaping both the technical and conversational capabilities of the chatbot interface.

## Result
The various types of prompts were executed successfully and applied to the use case of automating a manufacturing system. This resulted in a well-structured and user-centric design that meets the project's objectives effectively. And thus, the prompts were executed successfully.
